# Flight-Delays-in-Aviation
This project showcases my skills in building ML models using R.
# Introduction

As a member of the aviation data science team, you have been approached by David, the manager of flight control, to provide insights into flight delays within the region. The goal is to better understand the contributing factors and predict the likelihood of flight delays. This analysis will contribute to the development of a model that specifically identifies factors such as carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay, security delay, and late aircraft delay.

# Problem Statement
Flight Delay Prediction and Contributing Factors Analysis for Regional Flight Control

# Skills/Concept Demonstrated
The following concepts were used in this project;
1. Data Manipulation with dplyr
2. Test of Multicollinearity with Car
3. Data visualization with ggplot2
4. Baseline model using linear regression
        
         
# Data Sourcing
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle

# Methodology
1. Industry Problem Understanding
2. Problem statement generation
3. Domain Knowledge acquisition
4. Data preprocessing and cleaning
5. Exploratory data analysis;
   Univariate analysis,
   Bivariate analysis,
   Multivariate analysis
6.	Linear regression model using Arline flight late by 15min as dependent variable.

# Insight to find
1.	Discover patterns in flight delays over different months or seasons. Are there specific times of the year when delays are more common? 

2.	Identify the most significant contributors to flight delays. Explore which factors, such as carrier delays, weather delays, or late aircraft delays, have the most substantial impact on overall delays.


3.	Investigate the correlation between different types of delays. For example, are carrier delays correlated with late aircraft delays? Understanding these relationships can help in building a more nuanced predictive model.

4.	Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model in predicting flight delays. Identify which features are most influential in making accurate predictions.


5.	Predictive Power of the Model: Analyze how well the predictive model performs on the testing dataset. Understanding the accuracy can guide further model refinement and deployment.
